# Hashing-And-Algorithm-Practice
npm install
Run the server w/ npm run server
Open the index.html in your browser
play with hashing !

Basics are you get the data (red button) hash it (green button) and as of now you can search the names to get related data from the hash table.
There is a select menu that does nothing, it's for you to write your own sorting algorithms.

To display sort data you want to set the displayData global variable to the result of your algorithm.
Add a button to the html, add an event listner that points to your sorting function, and set displayData == result of your algo!
